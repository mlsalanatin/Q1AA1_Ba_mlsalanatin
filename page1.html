            <div class="photo1" title="December 2021. Grade 7. 13 years old. This was when I first met up with my new found friends. This is in Zuri's house. Me and my friend group decided to meet up. They were the first friends I gained during my first year in Pisay. I miss you all Czar, Zuri, Khail, Maruen, and Jared."></div>
            <div class="photo2" title="2022. Grade 8. 14 years old. Best year, best section, best everything. This was peak life. We got rejected by sports club so the majority of us are in Progdev. I made new friends. My life was more better and fun during this time."></div>
            <div class="photo3" title="2022. Kamia meet up. I didn't expect that I would enjoy being with my classmates. I am very introverted and I thought I would hate being with my classmates. I met someone special during that day. I wish I could go back."></div>
            <div class="photo4" title="2022. School Foundation Day/Pisay Night. This was the happiest and saddest day last school year. We had fun roaming around the campus when we were knotted together. I had fun trying out the different foods from the different booths. Something happened on Pisay Night (iykyk). I really didn't expect to be heartbroken that day. Even though that thing happened, everything worked out."></div>
            <div class="photo5" title="2022. Last day of school. I remember the tears I cried during this day. On the first day of school, I wanted the schoolyear to end already, but when it did end, I wanted it to last forever. I will always love Kamia. I miss my classmates and teachers. I will do everything to be Kamia again."></div>
            <div class="photo6" title="Present time (2023). 15 years old. This is me in the school's isolation room. Even though I was sick, I felt good. I really don't like grade 9. Being sick is the only time I get to rest. I feel so much better being sick. I hope everything will be okay. I hope I won't die this schoolyear"></div>
